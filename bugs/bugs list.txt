FIXED bug1:  when you click start, the start button renders terribly

FIXED bug2:  sometimes the mouse is set behind the button or animations

FIXED bug3:  doesnt look through all frames...it fails to load last frame and also only loops through all but last 2 frames.  this is odd.

FIXED bug4:  cant hit 1 of 2 buttons (baesd on the order i add them to the buttons list) on the menu screen.

bug5:  white-space of gates images aren't see through...why not?
